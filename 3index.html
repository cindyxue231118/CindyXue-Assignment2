            Orpiment</p>
        <p class="HeadPageP1">Orpiment: Ancient correction fluid. In ancient China, yellow paper was used to write on, and mistakes were corrected with orpiment, which was later used as a pigment for painting. The color has been used in paintings from Dunhuang murals to some Western oil paintings. It is often used in conjunction with andrographis, which is highly toxic, but is still used in Chinese paintings today.<br>
            <br>
            Realgar: The color of andrographis is darker than that of orpiment, more orange-red or orange-yellow. It is less commonly used as a pigment than orpiment, one of the reasons being that it is produced in smaller quantities. It is used in frescoes to complement the color of orpiment. Andrographis is highly toxic at high temperatures and is usually ground and dried naturally. It is often used in Chinese frescoes as well as Egyptian and Indian paintings.</p>
